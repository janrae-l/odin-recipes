        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a traditional Filipino recipe for lumpia, or fried spring rolls. They're made with paper-thin lumpia wrappers and filled with a savory mixture of ground pork, cabbage, and other vegetables. Serve lumpia as a side dish or appetizer with a sweet chili dipping sauce.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>½ cup minced carrots</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped green onions</li>
            <li>½ cup thinly sliced green cabbage</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <l>30 lumpia wrappers</l>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong>Cook the pork until crumbly and set aside. Drain most (but not all) of the grease. Cook the onion and garlic in the remaining grease. Return the pork to the pan and stir in the veggies, cilantro, and seasonings. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the lumpia:</strong> Place three tablespoons of the filling on the wrapper and follow the instructions to roll and seal the lumpia. Repeat until all the rolls are assembled.</li>
            <li><strong>Fry the lumpia:</strong> Heat oil in a skillet. Fry the lumpia three to four rolls at a time. Turn until all sides are brown. Drain on a paper towel.</li>
        </ol>
